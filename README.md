# New-Repeater
This project was made by me and my friend Kati Issam in c# this programme automate you texts for example if you want to write many things btwn a sentence you just enter the words that you want to enter them in a .txt file and you run the programme  you choose the name of the file the first sentece and the second then you chose where you want to add you items .

this programme helps us a lot in the insert in sql when we were studying in ista lazzaret 

example : 

i want to insert the cities :

1_ i write all the cities in .txt file  i will name it for example ville.txt
2_ i write the name of the file i hit enter 
3_ i chose the first sentence ex insert into villes ('
4_ then i write the second sentence  ');
5_ i Press enter and i chose the format type :

                    Console.WriteLine("\nChoose Format Type");
                    Console.WriteLine("1: Text1 + Array");
                    Console.WriteLine("2: Text1 + Array + Text2");
                    Console.WriteLine("3: Text1 + Array + Text2 + Array");
                    Console.WriteLine("4: Text1 + Array + Text2 + Array + Text3");
                    Console.WriteLine("5: Array + Text1");
                    Console.WriteLine("6: Array + Text1 + Array");
                    Console.WriteLine("7: Array + Text1 + Array + Text2");
                    Console.WriteLine("8: Array + Text1 + Array + Text2 + Array");
                    Console.WriteLine("9: Array + Text1 + Array + Text2 + Array + Text3");
                    Console.WriteLine("10: Text1 + Number + Text2 + Array + Text3");
                    Console.WriteLine("11: Text1 + Number + Text2 ");
                    
6_ if i chose 2 it  will put the cities btw the first and the second sentence

like this => insert into villes('here all you the villes that are in your .txt vile'); it will display as much as you have of cities in your txt file.
